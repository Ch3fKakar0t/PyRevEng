This is the latest instantiation of a long series of programable
reverse engineering/disassembly tools I have written.  Python seems
to work so well for this kind of work that I am trying to write a
general-purpose toolkit this time, which does not depend on a
particular memory layout, CPU architecture or for that matter
anything else.

For now, we are limited to 32 bits of memory width, but should
pythons array type grow a 64 bit subtype, we can go higher.

My two test-cases are the 6800 EPROM dump from an HP5370B Time
Interval Counter and various program files from an RC7000/DOMUS
system.
